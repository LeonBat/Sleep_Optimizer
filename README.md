# Sleep_Optimizer

Lately I have been feeling tired throughout the day and I was wondering how I could improve my sleep. So I came up with the idea to track it under different conditions and record my sleep quality.

In the end I will perform statistical analysis and visualize my results in a dynamic dashboard.

## The Dataset

For accumulating data I will daily update this repo and gather my sleeping data over a extensive period of time, always changing some parameters.

| Variable | Meaning | Type |
| -------- | ------- | ---- |
| Duration | The amount of time I sleep during the night | Decimal number |
| Sleep Mask | Wearing a sleep mask or not | Boolean |
| Screen Time | Did I use my phone before going to sleep (1hr before) | Boolean
| Sleep Latency | How many minutes to fall asleep | Decimal number |
| Sleep Efficiency| How many minutes in bed vs. how many minutes asleep | Decimal Number |
| **Sleep quality** | Subjective score from 1(bad) - 10(good) | ordinal integer |

## Important Notes
The sleep quality is subjective that means I am goint to evaluate how well rested I feel when I wake up and how active and energetic I feel throughout the day. It is the dependent variable in the dataset.

I will use an app called Sleep Cycle (https://sleepcycle.com/) to record my sleep latency and sleep efficiency.

Each "treatment" will be repeated for 3 days to make it representative and to exclude
